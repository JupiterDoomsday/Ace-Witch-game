  title: Summoning The Great Boyarde
  desc: The youths have enlisted you in stealing a can of processed spaghetti product
    from the mess hall stocks; an ingredient in some ramshackle ritual. Their fervor
    seems ill advised, yet it may be best to help them before they seek out some
    more outlandish and dangerous activity.
