  title: Treats For The Insect Parade
  desc: "Weary travelers searching the forests around lake Zurvan might find themselves
    puzzled as soft music permeates the loose canopy. Known to little, this is no
    trick of the mind, but the merry tune of a Great Insect Parade. This event is
    of immeasurable importance, and you shall now play an important role in delivering
    the parade\u2019s great feast. It\u2019s best not to keep the bugs nor Mandy
    waiting."
