  desc: "A nauseatingly sweet drink that is the favored beverage of fletchings and
    hatchlings alike. Created mostly to care for newborns in need of an extra source
    of magical energy, Witches\u2019 milk tends not to be synthesized by adults unless
    needed. As such, many young witches find witches milk to be their first alchemical
    concoction when taking matters into their own hands.\n\nLuckily for most youth,
    Witches milk can be easily synthesized from nightshade, dandelions, milk weed
    sap, river water, honey, and sage; all can be found during a quick jaunt in the
    woods.\n\n\n"
