  desc: "An elegant white mushroom with a history suiting its name. Used for millennia,
    these mushrooms have been strangely coveted for their ability to make even the
    hardiest witches keel over with nausea, intestinal pain, and other less desirable
    symptoms. Death Caps have been a constant staple of every prankster\u2019s repository,
    although in recent years the casual ingestion of the fungi has been met with
    more and more ire by older witches. Luckily for many hatchlings, Death Cap mushrooms
    are hilariously easy to find."
